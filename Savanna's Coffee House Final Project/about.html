                        <p>Savanna's Coffee House was founded in 2006 by MSU graduate students Michel Bohmer and Sandy
                            Thomas.
                            Located in the heart of MSU's campus town, we strived to make Savanna's Coffee House a fun,
                            funky,
                            relaxing yet upbeat destination for all students and locals to enjoy! We serve only the best
                            premium
                            products from our fresh roasted coffee and espresso drinks, hot and cold brewed iced teas,
                            grilled and
                            cold served sandwiches, and homemade soups and bakery items made fresh everyday. We made it
                            so there was
                            a little something for everyone to enjoy.

                            since their
                            collage days and wanted to bring the same love of coffee to their coffee shop for other
                            locals and
                            college students to enjoy like Michel and Sandy do!
